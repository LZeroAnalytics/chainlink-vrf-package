  Chainlink VRF
  ============
  This Kurtosis package instantiates a Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) environment. It includes OCR2VRF coordinators and operators for providing verifiable randomness to smart contracts.

  Prerequisites
  -------------
  - Access to an EVM-compatible blockchain with RPC endpoints
  - Deployed Chainlink VRF contracts on the target blockchain
  - Node operator credentials with funded ETH accounts

  Configuration
  -------------
  To configure this package, you'll need to provide the following information:
  - `rpc_url`: The RPC URL for the blockchain to connect to
  - `chain_id`: The chain ID of the blockchain network
  - `vrf_coordinator_address`: The address of the deployed VRF Coordinator contract
  - `link_token_address`: The address of the LINK token contract
  - `node_operator_keys`: Array of private keys for VRF node operators
  - `subscription_id`: The VRF subscription ID for funding randomness requests
  - `key_hash`: The public key hash for the VRF service
  - `confirmation_blocks`: Number of blocks to wait for confirmation
  - `max_gas_limit`: Maximum gas limit for VRF fulfillment transactions
