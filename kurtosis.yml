  Chainlink VRF
  ============
  This Kurtosis package instantiates a Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) environment. It includes OCR2VRF coordinators and operators for providing verifiable randomness to smart contracts.

  Prerequisites
  -------------
  - Access to an EVM-compatible blockchain with RPC endpoints
  - A funded wallet in that network

  Configuration
  -------------
  To configure this package, you'll need to provide the following information:
  - network
    - `rpc`: The RPC URL for the blockchain to connect to
    - `ws`: The WebSocket URL for the blockchain to connect to
    - `chain_id`: The chain ID of the blockchain network
    - `private_key`: The private key of the wallet to fund the VRF node operators
    - `faucet`: The URL of the faucet to fund the VRF node operators

  - vrf
    - `link_token_address`: The address of the LINK token contract on your netowrk (can provide empty string if want to create new by this package)
    - `lin_native_toeken_feed_address`: The address of the native token of your network with LINK (i.e. ETH/LINK) (can provide empty string if want to create new by this package)
